## Merge Queue System

This repository includes an automated merge queue system that allows batch merging of pull requests through GitHub issue templates and workflows.

### Prerequisites

Before using the merge queue system, ensure the following labels exist in your repository:

- `merge-queue` - Issues related to merge queue operations
- `automation` - Issues related to automated processes and workflows

**Creating Required Labels:**

If these labels don't exist, create them using the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh label create "merge-queue" --description "Issues related to merge queue operations" --color "0366d6"
gh label create "automation" --description "Issues related to automated processes and workflows" --color "f9d0c4"
```

### Using the Merge Queue

1. **Create a Merge Queue Request:**
   - Go to the Issues tab in GitHub
   - Click "New Issue"
   - Select "ðŸš€ Merge Queue Request" template
   - Fill in the required information:
     - PR Numbers (comma-separated list)
     - Release PR (optional)
     - Required Approvals Override (optional)
     - PR Summary

2. **Trigger the Merge Process:**
   - After creating the issue, comment `begin-merge` on the issue
   - The system will automatically tag the `merge-approvals` team for approval
   - Wait for team approval (up to 60 minutes with 15-minute reminders)
   - Once approved, the merge queue workflow executes automatically

3. **Prerequisites for PRs:**
   - âœ… All PRs have required approvals
   - âœ… All CI tests are passing
   - âœ… No merge conflicts exist
   - âœ… PRs target the default branch
   - âœ… You are a member of the `merge-approvals` team

### Workflow Features

- **Sequential Processing:** PRs are processed in chronological order (lowest PR number first)
- **Timeout Protection:** 60-minute approval timeout with automatic reminders
- **Consecutive Prevention:** Only one merge process per issue to prevent conflicts
- **Automatic Cleanup:** Issues are automatically closed after successful completion
- **Error Handling:** Failed PRs are updated with the default integration branch and owners are notified
