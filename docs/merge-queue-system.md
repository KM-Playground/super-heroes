# Merge Queue System Documentation

## Overview

The **Merge Queue System** is a sophisticated GitHub Actions workflow that automates the validation and sequential merging of multiple pull requests with approval workflows, duplicate run prevention, and comprehensive tracking. This system acts as a "merge queue drainer" by processing batches of PRs in a controlled, validated manner.

## Quick Setup

```bash
# Run the setup script to create required labels and check configuration
./scripts/setup-merge-queue.sh
```

## Prerequisites and Setup

### Required Labels

The following labels must exist in your repository:

#### 1. `merge-queue` (Required)
- **Purpose**: Identifies issues that can trigger merge queue workflows
- **Usage**: Applied to issues that contain merge queue requests
- **Creation**: `gh label create merge-queue --description "Issues that can trigger merge queue workflows" --color "0052cc"`

#### 2. `distributed-lock` (Required)
- **Purpose**: Identifies tracking issues used for duplicate run prevention
- **Usage**: Automatically applied to tracking issues created by the system
- **Creation**: `gh label create distributed-lock --description "Tracking issues for preventing duplicate merge queue runs" --color "d73a49"`

#### 3. `automation` (Optional but Recommended)
- **Purpose**: Identifies automated system-generated issues
- **Usage**: Applied to tracking issues and other automated content
- **Creation**: `gh label create automation --description "Automated system-generated content" --color "fbca04"`

### Required Team

#### `merge-approvals` Team
- **Purpose**: Team members who can approve/reject merge queue requests
- **Setup**: Create team in GitHub organization settings
- **Members**: Add users who should have merge queue approval permissions
- **Requirements**: Must have Write or Admin access to the repository

### Required Permissions

The workflow requires the following permissions in the `GITHUB_TOKEN`:
- `contents: read` - For repository access
- `issues: write` - For creating/closing tracking issues and posting comments
- `pull-requests: read` - For reading PR information

### Fine-Grained Personal Access Token

The workflow requires a special token to trigger CI workflows and access team membership:

**Steps to create the token:**
1. Go to **GitHub Settings** ‚Üí **Developer settings** ‚Üí **Personal access tokens** ‚Üí **Fine-grained tokens**
2. Click **"Generate new token"**
3. Configure with repository-specific access and these permissions:
   - **Administration**: **Read** access (for branch protection rules)
   - **Code**: **Read and Write** access (for branch operations)
   - **Metadata**: **Read** access (for basic repository information)
   - **Pull requests**: **Read and Write** access (for comments and workflow triggers)
   - **Members**: **Read** access (for organization team membership - **organization level permission**)
4. Store as repository secret named `CI_TRIGGER_TOKEN`

**Important Note:** The "Members" permission must be granted at the **organization level**, not just repository level, to access team membership information.

### GitHub Environment

Create a `merge_queue` environment:
1. Go to **repository Settings** ‚Üí **Environments**
2. Create environment named `merge_queue`
3. Add `merge-approvals` team as required reviewers
4. Set to "Protected branches only"

## Usage

### 1. Create a Merge Queue Request

**Option A: Using GitHub Issue Template**
1. Go to Issues tab ‚Üí New Issue
2. Select "üöÄ Merge Queue Request" template
3. Fill in PR numbers, release PR (optional), and summary

**Option B: Manual Issue Creation**
1. Create issue with `merge-queue` label
2. Include in body:
   ```
   PR Numbers: 123, 124, 125
   Release PR: 126 (optional)
   ```

### 2. Trigger the Merge Queue

Comment `begin-merge` on the issue to start the workflow.

### 3. Approval Process

1. **Individual Team Tagging**: Team members from `merge-approvals` are tagged individually
2. **Approval Methods**:
   - Comment "approved" or react with üëç
   - Comment "rejected" or react with üëé
3. **Authorization**: Only `merge-approvals` team members can approve/reject
4. **Timeout**: 60-minute timeout with 15-minute reminders

## How It Works

### Duplicate Run Prevention (Distributed Locking)

The system uses a distributed locking mechanism to prevent concurrent runs:

1. **Lock Check**: When `begin-merge` is commented, searches for existing tracking issues with:
   - Label: `distributed-lock`
   - Title pattern: `[MERGE QUEUE TRACKING] Issue #<original-issue-number>`

2. **Lock Creation**: If no existing lock found, creates tracking issue with:
   - Title: `[MERGE QUEUE TRACKING] Issue #<original-issue-number> - Auto Merge In Progress`
   - Labels: `distributed-lock`, `automation`
   - Body: Contains original issue reference, PR numbers, and status

3. **Lock Release**: Tracking issue automatically closed when workflow completes

### Workflow Execution Process

The workflow executes through multiple jobs with specific dependencies:

#### Job 1: Team Information Retrieval
- **Uses**: `CI_TRIGGER_TOKEN` with organization-level "Members" permission
- Retrieves `merge-approvals` team member list via GitHub API
- Formats individual member tags for better notifications
- Falls back to team tag if members cannot be accessed
- Exports team information for subsequent jobs

#### Job 2: Initialization with Duplicate Prevention
- **Script**: `initialize_merge_queue.py` (consolidated tracking issue management)
- **Depends on**: Team information from Job 1
- Checks for existing tracking issues using `distributed-lock` label
- Extracts PR information from issue body (PR numbers, release PR, required approvals)
- Creates new tracking issue if none exists
- Exports all data for subsequent jobs
- Aborts if duplicate run detected

#### Job 3: Team Approval Request
- **Uses**: Team information from Job 1
- Tags individual `merge-approvals` team members (or team tag as fallback)
- Waits for approval/rejection (60-minute timeout)
- Sends reminders every 15 minutes using team information

#### Job 4: PR Validation
- Validates PR existence and status
- Checks merge conflicts and approvals
- Categorizes PRs as mergeable/unmergeable

#### Job 5: Sequential PR Merging
- Processes PRs in chronological order (lowest number first)
- For each PR:
  1. Updates branch with latest default branch
  2. Triggers CI with "Ok to test" comment
  3. Waits for CI completion (45-minute timeout)
  4. Performs squash merge with standardized message
  5. Handles branch cleanup based on protection status

#### Job 6: Summary & Cleanup
- **Scripts**: `generate_summary.py` + `close_tracking_issue.py` (independent)
- Posts comprehensive summary to original issue
- Closes original issue automatically
- Closes tracking issue with completion status

## Key Features

### üîí Duplicate Run Prevention
- Uses distributed locks with `distributed-lock` labeled tracking issues
- Only one merge queue can run per issue at a time

- Enables faster problem resolution

### üè∑Ô∏è Standardized Merge Messages
- Consistent format: `[Merge Queue] #<PRNumber>-<PRTitle>-<BranchName>`
- Easy to search git history by PR number, keywords, or branch names
- Rich information content for better traceability

### üõ°Ô∏è Smart Branch Management
- Uses GitHub API to determine branch protection status
- Automatically preserves protected branches (releases, long-running features)
- Automatically cleans up temporary branches (features, bugfixes)
- No guesswork based on branch naming patterns

## Monitoring

### Active Merge Queues
```bash
# View active merge queue processes
gh issue list --label distributed-lock --state open

# View merge queue history
gh issue list --label merge-queue --state closed

# Check team membership
gh api orgs/YOUR_ORG/teams/merge-approvals/members
```

### Workflow Execution Tracking
- **GitHub Actions**: View workflow runs in repository Actions tab
- **Tracking Issues**: Monitor progress via distributed-lock labeled issues
- **Original Issues**: Check comments for detailed progress updates
- **PR Comments**: Individual failure notifications posted directly to PRs

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

The system uses configurable timeouts and parameters:

```yaml
env:
  APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MINUTES: "60"      # Approval timeout (default: 60)
  REMINDER_INTERVAL_MINUTES: "15"     # Reminder interval (default: 15)
  CI_TIMEOUT_MINUTES: "45"            # CI completion timeout (default: 45)
  MAX_STARTUP_WAIT: "300"             # CI startup timeout (default: 5 min)
  CHECK_INTERVAL: "30"                # Status check frequency (default: 30 sec)
```

### Timeout Configuration

| Setting | Default | Purpose | Recommended Range |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------------|
| APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MINUTES | 60 min | Team approval timeout | 30-120 min |
| CI_TIMEOUT_MINUTES | 45 min | CI execution timeout | 30-60 min |
| MAX_STARTUP_WAIT | 5 min | CI startup timeout | 3-10 min |
| REMINDER_INTERVAL_MINUTES | 15 min | Approval reminder frequency | 10-30 min |

### Branch Handling Logic

**Smart Branch Deletion:**
- **Protected Branches**: Automatically preserved (releases, long-running features)
- **Non-Protected Branches**: Automatically deleted after successful merge
- **Detection Method**: Uses GitHub API to check branch protection rules
- **Safe Defaults**: When in doubt, branches are preserved

**Merge Message Format:**
- **Standard PRs**: `[Merge Queue] #<PRNumber>-<PRTitle>-<BranchName>` (squash merge)
- **Release PRs**: `[Merge Queue] #<PRNumber>-<PRTitle>-<BranchName>` (merge commit)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### üîí "Duplicate run detected"
**Cause**: Another merge queue is already running for this issue
**Solution**: Wait for current process to complete or check tracking issue status
```bash
gh issue list --label distributed-lock --state open
```

#### üë• "Unauthorized approval"
**Cause**: User is not in `merge-approvals` team
**Solution**: Add user to team in GitHub organization settings
```bash
gh api orgs/YOUR_ORG/teams/merge-approvals/members
```

#### üè∑Ô∏è "Label not found"
**Cause**: Required labels don't exist in repository
**Solution**: Run setup script or create labels manually
```bash
./scripts/setup-merge-queue.sh
```

#### üß™ CI Tests Don't Trigger
**Cause**: `CI_TRIGGER_TOKEN` permissions or `pr-test.yaml` configuration
**Solutions**:
- Verify token permissions and expiration
- Check `pr-test.yaml` workflow exists and triggers on "Ok to test"
- Test manual trigger: `gh pr comment PR_NUMBER --body "Ok to test"`

#### üë• Team Member Access Issues
**Cause**: `CI_TRIGGER_TOKEN` lacks organization-level "Members" permission
**Symptoms**:
- Workflow fails at "Get team members" step
- Error: "403 Forbidden" or "Resource not accessible by integration"
- Falls back to generic team tag instead of individual member tagging
**Solutions**:
- Ensure `CI_TRIGGER_TOKEN` has **"Read access to members"** at **organization level**
- Verify token is not expired
- Check that `merge-approvals` team exists and has members
- Test manually: `gh api orgs/YOUR_ORG/teams/merge-approvals/members`

#### ‚è∞ Timeout Issues
**Cause**: CI execution or approval timeouts
**Solutions**:
- Increase timeout values in workflow configuration
- Optimize CI tests for faster execution
- Check GitHub Actions queue status during peak times

### Manual Recovery

If workflow fails partway through:
1. **Identify completed PRs**: Check workflow summary
2. **Update remaining PRs**: Manually update failed PRs with default branch
3. **Re-run with subset**: Trigger workflow with remaining PR numbers
4. **Clean up tracking**: Manually close stuck tracking issues if needed

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Standard Feature PR Batch
**Scenario**: Merging 5 feature PRs after sprint completion

**Issue Body**:
```
PR Numbers: 1234, 1235, 1236, 1237, 1238
```

**Expected Flow**:
1. Comment `begin-merge` ‚Üí Creates tracking issue
2. Team members tagged for approval
3. PRs validated and processed in order: #1234 ‚Üí #1235 ‚Üí #1236 ‚Üí #1237 ‚Üí #1238
4. Each PR: branch update ‚Üí CI trigger ‚Üí CI wait ‚Üí merge
5. Summary posted and issues closed

**Expected Duration**: 15-45 minutes (depending on CI times)

### Example 2: Release + Feature PRs
**Scenario**: Deploying release branch followed by hotfixes

**Issue Body**:
```
PR Numbers: 1240, 1241
Release PR: 1239
```

**Expected Flow**:
1. Release PR #1239 merged first (preserved branch)
2. Feature PRs #1240 and #1241 processed sequentially
3. Summary includes release merge status

**Expected Duration**: 20-50 minutes

## Best Practices

### For Users (PR Authors and Reviewers)

**Before triggering merge queue**:
- ‚úÖ Ensure all PRs are ready for merge and fully reviewed
- ‚úÖ Resolve any merge conflicts beforehand
- ‚úÖ Verify all required approvals are in place
- ‚úÖ Confirm all status checks are passing
- ‚úÖ Use descriptive commit messages (workflow uses squash merge)

**PR Preparation Checklist**:
- [ ] All required reviewers have approved
- [ ] CI tests are passing
- [ ] No merge conflicts with default branch
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed
- [ ] Breaking changes properly communicated
